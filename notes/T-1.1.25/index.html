      <p>How much humility would take for you to order all your guillotines to stop? So many efforts you have put to set this bloody operation going that now it's hard to even think of turning it on hold. Yes, results are outstanding, you've taken care of everything indeed, you even have been generous towards the sentenced for among all the types of executions you chose the most humane. The job gets done in seconds and with those "bastards" no more spoiling the party, the world you hope becomes a better place. In sounds of clanging blades you stand and look around The Justice Square... Behold what you have made.</p>
<p>Of course the longest line to Justice Square is made of politicians, the traffic drivers are standing right behind, and you could see bad parents, terrorists, door dealers, lawyers and many others if you stand up on your toes. And yet at least for once you must have thinking: how many guillotines you'll need? It cannot be they haven't heard about your dreadful fame already but why o'why the line of guilties never ends?</p>
<p>Any cycling situation, when you hit the same emotions despite the fact that scenery is not the same, is a potential siren call which when combined inevitably lead you to an extraordinary question: what if the source of all you see is placed in nowhere but within? What if you're occupying not the viewer's chair in movies but in projector's room instead? What if your eyes are not receivers but transmitters of the signal, would not this tell you why the death row at the Justice Square is full? What is the point beheading further when you have learned: the only damaged neck has always been but yours?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ... course ... is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception. The means of the Atonement is forgiveness. C-In.1</p>
<p>Forgiveness, salvation, Atonement, true perception, all are one. C-4.3</p>
<p>Forgiveness is the central theme that runs throughout salvation, holding all its parts in meaningful relations, the course it runs directed, and its outcome sure. W-169.12</p>
<p>The way to God is through forgiveness here. There is no other way. W-256</p>
<p>hold no one prisoner. Release instead of bind, for thus are you made free. The way is simple. Every time you feel a stab of anger, realize you hold a sword above YOUR head. And it will fall or be averted as you choose to be condemned or free. Thus does each one who seems to tempt you to be angry represent your savior from the prison house of death. And so you owe him thanks instead of pain. Be merciful today. The Son of God deserves your mercy. W-192.9</p>
