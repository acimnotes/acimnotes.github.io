It cannot be louder without violating your freedom of choice, which the Holy Spirit seeks to restore, never to undermine."], ["T-8.8.5", "Sickness is meaningful only if the two basic premises on which the ego\u0027s interpretation of the body rests are true; that the body is for attack, and that you are a body."], ["T-16.6.8", "Delay will hurt you now more than before, only because you realize it is delay, and that escape from pain is really possible."], ["T-28.7.2", "There is no middle ground in any aspect of salvation. You accept it wholly or accept it not."], ["T-13.10.8", "The moment that you realize: guilt is insane, wholly unjustified and wholly without reason, you will not fear to look upon the Atonement, and accept it wholly."], ["T-5.7.5", "Whenever you are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reacted with a lack of love to one of God\u0027s creations ... The decision to react in this way is yours, and can therefore be undone."], ["T-7.7.4", "The only way to dispel illusions is to withdraw all investment from them, and they will have no life for you because you will have put them out of your mind."], ["T-7.7.2", "When a brother acts insanely, he is offering you an opportunity to bless him. His need is YOURS. You NEED the blessing you can offer him. There is no way for you to have it EXCEPT by giving it. This is the law of God, and it has NO exceptions."], ["T-7.7.6", "You cannot know your own perfection until you have honoured all those who were created LIKE you."], ["T-7.7.3", "Your brother is the mirror in which you see the image of yourself as long as perception lasts."], ["T-5.2.9", "My mind will always be like yours, because we were created as equals. It was only my decision that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. My only gift to you is to help you make the same decision."], ["T-5.2.12", "I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but we must respond to the same Mind to do this. This Mind is the Holy Spirit, Whose Will is for God always. He teaches you how to keep me as the model for your thought, and to behave like me as a result."], ["T-5.2.4", "You are the Kingdom of Heaven, but you have let the belief in darkness enter your mind and so you need a new light. The Holy Spirit is the radiance that you must let banish the idea of darkness."], ["M-22.2", "The progress of the teacher of God may be slow or rapid, depending on whether he recognizes the Atonement\u0027s inclusiveness, or, for a time, excludes some problem areas from it."], ["M-22.1", "Healing and Atonement are not related; they are identical ... To forgive is to heal."], ["M-22.3", "The idea that a body can be sick is a central concept in the ego\u0027s thought system. This thought gives the body autonomy, separates it from the mind, and keeps the idea of attack inviolate. If the body could be sick Atonement would be impossible."], ["M-22.6", "A sick person perceives himself as separate from God. Would you see him as separate from you? It is your task to heal the sense of separation that has made him sick. It is your function to recognize for him that what he believes about himself is not the truth. It is your forgiveness that must show him this."], ["T-21.in.1", "The world you see is ... the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition ...

Health is inner peace."], ["T-31.5.17", "There is no statement that the world is more afraid to hear than this: \"I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself\". Yet in this learning is salvation born. And What you are will tell you of Itself."], ["T-31.5.17", "When every concept has been raised to doubt and question, and been recognized as made on no assumptions that would stand the light, then is the truth left free to enter in its sanctuary, clean and free of guilt."], ["W-190.6", "My holy brother, think of this awhile: The world you see does nothing. It has no effects at all. It merely represents your thoughts. And it will change entirely as you elect to change your mind, and choose the joy of God as what you really want."], ["W-190.5", "It is your thoughts alone that cause you pain. Nothing external to your mind can hurt or injure you in any way."], ["W-190.9", "Lay down the cruel sword of judgment that you hold against your throat, and put aside the withering assaults with which you seek to hide your holiness."], ["T-14.11.8", "It is only because you think that you can run some little part, or deal with certain aspects of your life alone, that the guidance of the Holy Spirit is limited."], ["T-25.8.1", "The Holy Spirit can use all that you give to Him for your salvation. But He cannot use what you withhold, for He cannot take it from you without your willingness."], ["T-14.11.6", "Your part is very simple. You need only recognize, that everything you learned, you do not want. Ask to be taught, and do not use your experiences to confirm what you have learned."], ["T-14.11.7", "You cannot be your guide to miracles, for it is you who made them necessary."], ["T-9.4.2", "You do not understand how to overlook errors, or you would not make them. It would merely be further error to believe either that you do not make them, or that you can correct them without a Guide to correction."], ["T-6.4.2", "You could not remain within the Kingdom without love, and since the Kingdom is love, you believe that you are without it."], ["T-11.5.18", "Everything you perceive is a witness to the thought system you want to be true."], ["T-11.5.18", "You hear but your own voice"], ["T-11.5.17", "Would you remember the Father? Accept His Son and you will remember Him."], ["T-11.5.13", "The ego analyzes; the Holy Spirit accepts. The appreciation of wholeness comes only through acceptance, for to analyze means to break down or to separate out."], ["T-12.7.12", "Everything you behold without is a judgment of what you beheld within."], ["W-71.1", "You may not realize that the ego has set up a plan for salvation in opposition to God\u0027s. It is this plan in which you believe."], ["W-71.2", "The ego\u0027s plan for salvation centers around holding grievances."], ["T-9.4.9", "The Second Coming is merely the return of sense."], ["W-198.4", "Forgiveness is the only road that leads out of disaster, past all suffering, and finally away from death. How could there be another way, when this one is the plan of God Himself? And why would you oppose it, quarrel with it, seek to find a thousand ways in which it must be wrong; a thousand other possibilities?"], ["T-8.3.5", "Know thyself. There is nothing else to learn."], ["W-106", "Let me be still and listen to the truth."], ["W-192.10", "Be merciful today. The Son of God deserves your mercy."], ["W-192.10", "Your function here on earth is only to forgive him, that you may accept him back as your Identity."], ["T-4.4.10", "The Second Coming of Christ means nothing more than the end of the ego\u0027s rule and the healing of the mind."], ["T-3.7.5", "Your starting point is truth, and you must return to your Beginning."], ["T-8.4.3", "As God sent me to you so will I send you to others. And I will go to them with you, so we can teach them peace and union."], ["T-11.8.5", "This is not a course in the play of ideas, but in their practical application."], ["T-6.in.2", "Your capacity for allegiance to a thought system may be misplaced, but it is still a form of faith and can be redirected."], ["T-7.6.1", "If [attack] is not relinquished entirely it is not relinquished at all."], ["M-4.8.1", "Patience is natural to those who trust."], ["W-75.3", "we offer thanks for the passing of the old and the beginning of the new. No shadows from the past remain to darken our sight and hide the world forgiveness offers us."], ["T-25.6.6", "Salvation is no more than a reminder this world is not your home."], ["T-8.3.5", "if you look only at yourself you cannot find yourself, because that is not what you are."], ["T-26.8.2", "trust would settle every problem now."], ["T-10.2.4", "If you further recognize that you are part of God, you will understand why it is that you always attack yourself first. All attack is Self attack.
