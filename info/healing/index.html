<p>So you've got yourself familiar with the Course, your doubts on if it's true are fading, and now you are willing to make the next big step -- move from theory to practice. And although this step is natural in any learning, with ACIM it isn't easy because most of the beliefs the book claims we have are deeply unconscious and we are not aware of them. In chapter 19 for example it talks about The Fear of God that we all have, or maybe a more practical example that all sickness is only in the mind, who on Earth is aware of that? Most people believe they love God, just as they believe that diseases come from anything but from their own mind.</p>
<p>From my 10+ years of experience in spirituality and psychotherapy, I found that all of the blocks to love (fears and grievances) come from our yearly childhood experiences happened from 0 to 7 years old. Most of those painful experiences we erase from our memory, just like in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a> movie. And now when we read the Workbook lesson 31 "I am never the victim of the world I see" we get totally surprised and sometimes we even protest, because this statement sounds totally outrages. How can I not be a victim of this? How can they not be the victims of that? And so on. </p>
<p>But even if we can accept the idea, it is still very hard to uncover and to heal those psychological traumas from our past that still affect our present. That's why many people these days say that talk therapy or affirmations are not very effective. One possible reason for it is that these methods don't touch the deeper, subconscious level of our mind, modern neuroscience calls this the level of neural networks in our brain and how difficult it is to re-frame our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">Default Mode Network</a>.  </p>
<p>All of this may explain why ACIM lays out it's Workbook for a whole year of studying. And I found that using regression sessions could be an extremely helpful additional tool to elevate our understanding of the theoretical foundation presented in ACIM and to fasten our work on healing the mind from past traumas that cause negative patterns in our lives today (relationships issues, psychosomatic health issues, negative thoughts, depression, addictions, etc). </p>
